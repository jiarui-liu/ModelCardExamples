## Uses

### Direct Use

To use the model google/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224 without fine-tuning, post-processing, or plugging into a pipeline, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

2. Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')
```
This code snippet uses the `MobileNetV2` model from TensorFlow's Keras API and loads the pre-trained weights trained on the ImageNet dataset. The `weights='imagenet'` argument ensures that the model is initialized with the pre-trained weights.

3. Preprocess the input image:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import preprocess_input
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image

# Load and preprocess the input image
img_path = 'path_to_input_image.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
img = image.img_to_array(img)
img = preprocess_input(img)
```
This code snippet loads and preprocesses the input image. It resizes the image to the required input size of MobileNetV2 (224x224) and applies the necessary preprocessing steps to align with the model's expectations.

4. Make predictions using the pre-trained model:
```python
import numpy as np

# Expand dimensions to create a batch of size 1
img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(img)
```
This code snippet makes predictions on the preprocessed input image using the loaded MobileNetV2 model. The `predict` method returns the predicted probabilities for each class in the ImageNet dataset.

Note: The output `predictions` will be a 2D array with shape `(1, 1000)`, where the second dimension represents the probabilities for each of the 1000 ImageNet classes.

Please note that this code snippet assumes you have a single input image. If you want to process multiple images, you can iterate over them and repeat the above steps for each image.

## Model Examination

Model Card: google/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224

Model Description:
The google/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224 model is a highly efficient mobile model architecture designed for mobile applications. It has several properties that make it suitable for mobile devices, including memory-efficient inference and the utilization of standard operations present in all neural frameworks [1].

This model architecture improves the state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of performance points on the ImageNet dataset [1]. It introduces a unique convolutional block that separates the network expressiveness from its capacity, which is an important direction for future research [2][3][4]. This separation allows for a better understanding of the network properties [3].

One interesting property of this architecture is the natural separation between the input/output domains of the building blocks (bottleneck layers) and the layer transformation. The former represents the capacity of the network at each layer, while the latter represents the expressiveness. This is in contrast to traditional convolutional blocks where expressiveness and capacity are tangled [4].

The model incorporates linear bottlenecks, which have shown to improve performance. Despite being less powerful than models with non-linearities, linear bottlenecks provide better results and suggest that non-linearity destroys information in low-dimensional space [5].

The model has been experimented with three design variations for building a mobile model: different feature extractors, simplifying the DeepLabv3 heads for faster computation, and different inference strategies for boosting performance [6]. The results indicate that certain inference strategies increase the Multiply-Adds (MAdds) and are not suitable for on-device applications [6].

The model has been trained and evaluated with the Open Source TensorFlow Object Detection API. It has been benchmarked and compared in terms of mAP, number of parameters, and number of Multiply-Adds [7]. MobileNetV2 SSDLite is the most efficient model and also the most accurate among the compared models [7].
