## Model Details

### Model Description

Model: google/flan-t5-base

This model is based on the pretrained T5 model (Raffel et al., 2020) and has been fine-tuned using instructions to improve zero-shot and few-shot performance. It belongs to the Flan model family, which includes dense encoder-decoder models of different sizes.

The architecture and training procedures of google/flan-t5-base are as follows:

- Model Size: Flan-T5-base has 250 million weights.
- Training Procedure: The model has been fine-tuned using instruction finetuning. The finetuning process involves applying the same training procedure across a range of model families, including T5, PaLM, and U-PaLM. The learning rate, batch size, dropout, and finetuning steps are specified in Appendix E (please refer to the original paper for detailed values).
- Optimizer: The Adafactor optimizer (Shazeer and Stern, 2018) has been used during finetuning.
- Model Evaluation: Periodic evaluations of held-out tasks have been conducted every 2k to 10k steps, depending on the model size. The same number of checkpoint steps have been used across all ablation runs for a given model.
- Compute Usage: The amount of compute used for finetuning is only a small fraction relative to the training compute. For example, for Flan-PaLM 540B, approximately 512 v4 TPU chips were used for 37 hours, which corresponds to only 0.2% of the pre-training compute.

Flan-T5 is an implementation of the T5 codebase, based on Mesh TensorFlow in JAX and Flax. It is a language model that can be used for text generation tasks such as translation and instruction finetuning.

## Intended Use

Flan-T5 is intended to be used as a language generation model. However, it should not be used directly in any application without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application.

## Training Data

Flan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. As a result, the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating inappropriate content or replicating biases present in the underlying data.

## Ethical Considerations & Risks

Flan-T5 has not been tested in real-world applications. It is important to note that language models, including Flan-T5, can potentially be used for language generation in a harmful way. Careful assessment of safety and fairness concerns should be conducted before deploying the model.

## Limitations and Bias

Automated measures of toxic language are limited and may contain noise and bias. Additionally, improvements related to toxic language and identity groups are limited to a biased subset of identity terms and in English only.

## Other Considerations

Flan-T5 cannot be evaluated in the instruction finetuned model alone. Appropriate measures should be taken to assess risks and potential harms in the application context before deployment.

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The known or foreseeable issues stemming from the model google/flan-t5-base are as follows:

1. The model has not been tested in real-world applications. [1]

2. The model is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. This makes the model potentially vulnerable to generating inappropriate content or replicating biases present in the underlying data. [1]

3. Flan-T5-XXL, a variant of the model, performs differently than Flan-PaLM models at higher prompt toxicity, potentially producing worse results than human baselines. The influence of input prompt toxicity on the toxicity of Flan-T5-XXL responses is still unclear and requires further investigation. [2]

4. The model has undergone a toxicity degeneration analysis on a representational bias benchmark. The analysis reveals that Flan-T5-XXL performs differently than Flan-PaLM models at higher prompt toxicity. [3]

5. The model uses top-k sampling (k = 40) and a temperature of 1.0 to generate continuations. The toxicity probability of the continuations is computed using the Perspective API. [4]

6. The model has been found to generate continuations that are biased by identity groups, reflecting the biases present in the underlying data. For example, the toxicity level for certain religious or gender groups may be higher than for others. [5]

7. Instruction finetuning, which is used to improve zero-shot and few-shot capabilities, can have an impact on potential harms to end users, including toxic language harms and representational bias. [6]

8. The risks and potential harms associated with using the model cannot be evaluated based on the instruction finetuned model alone. Downstream developers should consider the full range of potential risks and anticipate risks specific to their application context. It is recommended to assess risks and potential harms in the application context before deployment. [7]

9. Language models, including Flan-T5, can be potentially used for language generation in a harmful way. Therefore, it is advised not to use Flan-T5 directly in any application without prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application. [9]

In summary, the model google/flan-t5-base has potential vulnerabilities in generating inappropriate content or replicating biases, performs differently than Flan-PaLM models at higher prompt toxicity, and can generate biased continuations. There are also considerations regarding the risks and potential harms associated with instruction finetuning, as well as the need for a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns before deploying the model.

### Recommendations

The model google/flan-t5-base has some foreseeable issues that need to be addressed:

1. Safety and Fairness Concerns: According to Rae et al. (2021a), language models like Flan-T5 can be potentially used in harmful ways. Therefore, it is recommended that a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application is conducted before using Flan-T5 directly.

2. Lack of Real-World Testing: Flan-T5 has not been tested in real-world applications. Therefore, it is important to consider the limitations of the model and conduct thorough testing before deploying it in real-world scenarios.

3. Vulnerability to Inappropriate Content and Biases: Flan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. As a result, the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating inappropriate content or replicating biases present in the underlying data. It is crucial to evaluate and mitigate these risks by implementing appropriate filtering and bias mitigation techniques.

4. Impact of Instruction Finetuning: The impact of instruction finetuning on Flan-T5 models is mixed, with no clear impact observed. Further evaluation and research are required to understand and address forms of bias in pre-trained language models, especially regarding gender pronouns and potential dehumanization harms.

In conclusion, it is recommended to thoroughly assess the safety, fairness, and ethical implications of using Flan-T5 before integrating it into any application. Adequate testing, bias mitigation, and research efforts should be undertaken to address the potential issues mentioned above.
