## Model Details

### Model Description

Model Name: albert-large-v2

Model Architecture:
The ALBERT architecture is similar to BERT, using a transformer encoder with GELU nonlinearities. It follows BERT notation conventions with the vocabulary embedding size denoted as E, the number of encoder layers as L, and the hidden size as H. The feed-forward/filter size is set to 4H, and the number of attention heads is set to H/64.

Training Procedures:
The model is trained using a maximum length of n-gram of 3 for the MLM target. The training is done using a batch size of 4096 and the LAMB optimizer with a learning rate of 0.00176. Training is performed for 125,000 steps unless otherwise specified. Training is done on Cloud TPU V3, with the number of TPUs used ranging from 64 to 512 depending on the model size.

Parameters:
The model has a large number of parameters, potentially resulting in billions of parameters, most of which are only updated sparsely during training. The exact number of parameters for albert-large-v2 is not specified.

Important Disclaimers:
The ALBERT models consistently improve downstream task performance for multi-sentence encoding. The model transitions from layer to layer are smoother compared to BERT, indicating the stabilizing effect of weight-sharing. However, the input and output embeddings for each layer do not converge to 0 even after 24 layers. ALBERT-xxlarge has less parameters than BERT-large and achieves better results, but it is computationally more expensive. The training and inference speed of ALBERT can be improved through methods like sparse attention and block attention.

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The known or foreseeable issues stemming from the ALBERT-Large-v2 model are as follows:

1. Computational Expense: ALBERT-Large-v2 has a larger structure compared to BERT-Large, resulting in increased computational expense for training and inference. This can limit its accessibility and practical deployment.

2. Diminishing Returns: Increasing the hidden size of ALBERT-Large-v2 can lead to diminishing returns in performance. At a hidden size of 6144, the model's performance appears to decline significantly.

3. Limited Representation Power: The current self-supervised training losses used in ALBERT-Large-v2 may not capture all dimensions of language, potentially limiting the representation power of the resulting embeddings.

4. Memory Limitations: The large size of ALBERT-Large-v2 can pose memory limitations on available hardware, making it challenging to train and deploy the model effectively.

5. Speed and Efficiency: Although ALBERT models have higher data throughput compared to their corresponding BERT models, ALBERT-Large-v2 is slower than BERT-Large due to its larger structure. Improving the training and inference speed of ALBERT remains an important area of research.

6. Sociotechnical Considerations: Deploying ALBERT-Large-v2 may raise sociotechnical concerns related to fairness, bias, and accountability. These considerations need to be addressed to ensure that the model's deployment does not amplify existing social inequities or perpetuate harmful biases.

Please note that the model card may require additional information not provided in the references, and further analysis may be needed to fully understand all the technical and sociotechnical limitations of ALBERT-Large-v2.

### Recommendations

Based on the references provided, here are the recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model albert-large-v2:

1. Improve Computational Efficiency: ALBERT-xxlarge, which has fewer parameters than BERT-large and achieves better results, is computationally more expensive due to its larger structure. To address this issue, it is recommended to explore methods like sparse attention and block attention to speed up the training and inference speed of ALBERT.

2. Optimize Model Size: Increasing the hidden size of ALBERT-large beyond a certain point (e.g., 6144) may result in diminishing returns in performance. It is important to find the optimal hidden size to maximize performance. Additionally, given the memory limitations of available hardware, it is crucial to consider the trade-offs between model size and performance.

3. Pretraining Data: To ensure meaningful comparison, it is recommended to follow the BERT setup by using BOOKCORPUS and English Wikipedia for pretraining baseline models. These two corpora consist of around 16GB of uncompressed text.

4. Maximum Length of N-gram: The maximum length of n-gram for the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) target is set to 3. This means the MLM target can consist of up to a 3-gram of complete words. For example, "White House correspondents" can be a valid MLM target. This limitation should be considered when designing and evaluating the model.

5. Training Parameters: The model updates use a batch size of 4096 and a LAMB optimizer with a learning rate of 0.00176. It is recommended to follow these parameters unless there are specific requirements or considerations for the target task.

6. Consider Additional Learning Tasks: While sentence order prediction (SOP) is a consistently useful learning task, there could be more dimensions not yet captured by the current self-supervised training losses. It is recommended to explore additional learning tasks that could further enhance the representation power of the resulting representations.

7. Evaluate Downstream Task Performance: ALBERT models consistently improve downstream task performance for multi-sentence encoding. It is important to evaluate the performance of albert-large-v2 on specific downstream tasks to assess its effectiveness and suitability for real-world applications.

Please note that the provided recommendations are based on the available references. Further analysis and experimentation might be needed to fully address the foreseeable issues with the model albert-large-v2.

## Training Details

### Training Data

The training data for the ALBERT-large-v2 model consists of the BOOKCORPUS and English Wikipedia datasets, which together contain around 16GB of uncompressed text. The inputs are formatted as "[CLS] x1 [SEP] x2 [SEP]", where x1 and x2 represent the textual content. For more information, you can refer to Reference 1.

### Training Procedure

#### Preprocessing

The preprocessing for the data of the ALBERT model albert-large-v2 involves tokenization and resizing/rewriting.

Tokenization:
ALBERT uses the WordPiece tokenization method, similar to BERT. The inputs are formatted as "[CLS] x1 [SEP] x2 [SEP]", where x1 and x2 represent the input text. The tokenization splits the input text into subwords or word pieces, allowing the model to learn context-independent representations.

Resizing/Rewriting:
The model uses a sentence-order prediction (SOP) loss to model inter-sentence coherence. The SOP loss uses positive examples, which are two consecutive segments from the same document, and negative examples, which are the same two consecutive segments with their order swapped. This loss focuses on modeling discourse-level coherence properties.

The ALBERT architecture is similar to BERT and utilizes a transformer encoder with GELU nonlinearities. The ALBERT-large model has a large structure with a higher number of encoder layers (L) and a larger hidden size (H) compared to BERT. The feed-forward/filter size is set to 4H, and the number of attention heads is set to H/64.

The vocabulary embedding size (E) is separate from the hidden layer size (H) in ALBERT, allowing for more efficient usage of parameters.

In terms of preprocessing, the data used for pretraining the ALBERT-large model includes the BOOKCORPUS and English Wikipedia, which consist of around 16GB of uncompressed text.

Overall, the preprocessing involves WordPiece tokenization and the use of the SOP loss to model inter-sentence coherence. The ALBERT-large model has a larger structure and separate vocabulary embedding size, which contributes to its improved performance.

Note: The specific details of tokenization and resizing/rewriting code are not provided in the references.

## Technical Specification

### Model Architecture and Objective

The ALBERT architecture of the albert-large-v2 model is based on BERT. It uses a transformer encoder with GELU nonlinearities. The model has a vocabulary embedding size denoted as E, the number of encoder layers denoted as L, and hidden size denoted as H. The feed-forward/filter size is set to 4H, and the number of attention heads is set to H/64. The model makes three main contributions over BERT's design choices, including learning finer-grained distinctions about discourse-level coherence properties. The model also exhibits smoother transitions between layers compared to BERT. 

The model uses a factorization of the embedding parameters to reduce the embedding parameters from O(V × H) to O(V × E + E × H). This is done by projecting the one-hot vectors into a lower dimensional embedding space of size E before projecting them into the hidden space of size H. 

The objective of the model is to achieve state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing tasks. The model has a large network, which is important for its performance. However, it is computationally more expensive compared to BERT due to its larger structure. Speeding up the training and inference speed is an important next step for the model.
